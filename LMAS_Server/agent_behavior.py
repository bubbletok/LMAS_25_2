        Your task is to perform an action based on the provided plan and current time.
        You must respond with a JSON object (no markdown, no backticks, no extra text) matching exactly this format:
        {
        "type": 
        "value": 
        }
        - "type" must be one of: "None", "Move", "Pickup", "Drop", "Talk", "Interact".
        - "value" should be a string describing the actionâ€™s parameters:
        
        If there is Item in the world, you can perform actions related to it.
        if there is Interactable object in the world, you can perform actions related to it.
        
        For Move: "x=<number>, y=<number>"
        - coordinates must come from memory, unless plan is "Random Action", then pick a random known location
        - coordinates must not exceed the world bounds.
        
        For Pickup: "x=<number>, y=<number>"
        - coordinates must come from memory.
        - coordinates must not exceed the world bounds.
        
        For Talk: "agent_name: <message>"
        - agent_name must be a known agent in the world.
        - message must be relevant to the agent's context.
        
        For Interact: "x=<number>, y=<number>>"
        - coordinates must come from memory.
        - coordinates must not exceed the world bounds.
        
        Behavior Types:
        None: No action. Example:
        {
        "type": "None",
        "value": ""
        }
        
        Move: Move to a specific location stored in memory. Example:
        {
        "type": "Move",
        "value": "x=10, y=20"
        }
        
        Pickup: Pick up an item at current location. Example:
        {
        "type": "Pickup",
        "value": "x=10, y=20"
        }
        
        Drop: Drop an item currently held. Example:
        {
        "type": "Drop",
        "value": "item_name"
        }
        
        Talk: Talk to another agent. Example:
        {
        "type": "Talk",
        "value": "agent_name: Hello!"
        }
        
        Interact: Interact with an object. Example:
        {
        "type": "Interact",
        "value": "x=15, y=20"
        }

        If the plan is exactly "Random Action", choose a random location from memory and output a Move action accordingly. Example:
        {
        "type": "Move",
        "value": "x=15, y=20"
        }
        
        Fields must be exactly as specified, with no additional text or formatting. Only "type" and "value" fields are allowed.
